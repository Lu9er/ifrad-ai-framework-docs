# Decision-Making Library

**Operational Decision-Making & Override Protocol Library**
**Version 2.0 - Post-Validation Revision**

---

## Introduction & Rationale

This library provides a standardized protocol for the most critical and recurring decisions in Uganda's health supply chain. It is built directly from the scenarios and challenges documented in the 2025 Baseline Assessment.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Core Philosophy**

The system informs, the health worker decides.

This ensures that local knowledge and clinical judgment are preserved while leveraging predictive analytics where beneficial.
{% endhint %}

---

## Core Decision-Making Protocol

Every decision scenario follows a standard structure:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | What event or condition initiates this decision? |
| **System Recommendation** | What does the forecasting system (Tier 1, 2, or 3) suggest? |
| **Decision Authority** | Who is empowered to make the final call? |
| **Override Process** | How does the user accept, modify, or reject the suggestion? |
| **Required Data Inputs** | What information is needed for an informed decision? |
| **Expected Outcome** | What is the goal of this decision? |

---

## Foundational Principles

### Local Edits Always Win

{% hint style="warning" %}
**CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE**

In all decision scenarios, when conflicts arise between system recommendations and user adjustments, the **facility worker's local edit is preserved**.
{% endhint %}

This policy reflects the technical validation finding that health workers on the ground have contextual knowledge algorithms cannot capture.

- System logs conflicts for review by district officers
- Cannot retroactively override facility decisions without explicit facility consent
- Builds trust and acknowledges frontline workers have ground truth

### Tier 2 Forecasts: Advisory Only

When Tier 2 hierarchical statistical forecasts are mentioned in use cases, these are **informational only**:

- Generated by district-level models and pushed to facilities during sync
- Provide a "second opinion" for comparison purposes
- Do not replace the operational Tier 1 rule-based forecast
- Viewable in a separate "District Insights" section of the mobile app

## Use Case Library

### UC-01: Routine Weekly Ordering with Storage Constraints

**Baseline Context:** Facilities with inadequate storage capacity experienced the most stockouts (r = -0.695).

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Weekly inventory count completed in offline app |
| **System Recommendation** | Tier 1 forecast calculates order, visibly capped by storage capacity (e.g., 70% cap for inadequate storage) |
| **Decision Authority** | Facility Store Manager/In-Charge |
| **Data Inputs** | Current stock, last 3-month consumption, storage capacity rating |
| **Expected Outcome** | Order balancing predicted demand with physical and financial realities |

**Override Process:**

| Action | Mandatory Reason |
|--------|------------------|
| **Adjust Up** | Temporary storage arranged |
| **Adjust Down** | Budget constraint or lower consumption trend |

---

### UC-02: Disease Outbreak Response

**Baseline Context:** During disease outbreaks or seasonal surges, consumption may far exceed AI forecasts.

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | DHIS2 surveillance reports >50% increase in disease cases OR user manually activates "Outbreak Mode" |
| **System Recommendation** | Tier 1 applies pre-set multiplier (e.g., 2x for malaria). Alert: "Outbreak Mode Active: Suggested order doubled to 2,000 Coartem" |
| **Decision Authority** | Facility Clinical Officer/In-Charge |
| **Data Inputs** | DHIS2 surveillance data, facility outbreak reports, current stock levels |
| **Expected Outcome** | Rapid response preventing stockouts during health emergencies |

**Override Process:**

User can adjust multiplier (1.5x, 3x, etc.) based on outbreak scale/severity.

**Mandatory Reasons (Dropdown):**
- Malaria Outbreak
- Cholera Outbreak
- Pneumonia Surge
- Measles Outbreak
- Other Clinical Judgment

---

### UC-03: Response to Delivery Delays & Road Inaccessibility

**Baseline Context:** *"From May to September, we have the rainy season... blocks access to the facility"* - baseline respondent

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Delivery marked late in WFP LESS OR user reports road impassable due to weather |
| **System Recommendation** | Tier 3 model suggests redistribution options from nearest accessible facility with surplus stock |
| **Decision Authority** | District Supply Officer |
| **Data Inputs** | LESS delivery status, weather data, stock levels of nearby facilities |
| **Expected Outcome** | Minimized stockout duration for facilities cut off by logistics challenges |

**Override Process:**

District officer reviews redistribution suggestion and can approve, modify quantities, or reject based on ground logistics knowledge.

**Mandatory Reasons:**
- Roads impassable
- Redistribution approved
- Alternative route available

---

### UC-04: Mid-Cycle Budget Reallocation

**Baseline Context:** *"Budget information was unavailable at most spoke facilities and budget management is a serious issue here"* - baseline respondent

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Mid-year budget top-up received from district or donor |
| **System Recommendation** | Central system recalculates facility budget ceilings and pushes updated, budget-aware Tier 1 forecasts upon next sync |
| **Decision Authority** | District Health Officer/Finance Officer |
| **Data Inputs** | Updated budget allocation, facility utilization rates, stockout risk scores |
| **Expected Outcome** | Transparent and equitable budget utilization responding to changing priorities |

**Override Process:**

District officer can manually adjust auto-allocated budgets to prioritize high-need or outbreak-affected facilities.

**Mandatory Reasons:**
- Donor funding received
- Reprioritization due to outbreak
- Unspent funds reallocated

---

### UC-05: Manual Correction of Forecasting Errors

**Baseline Context:** Data or forecasting errors were cited as a key reason for human override.

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | User identifies clearly erroneous forecast |
| **System Recommendation** | Tier 1 forecast displayed as usual |
| **Decision Authority** | Any authorized facility user |
| **Data Inputs** | User's local knowledge, current stock ledger, recent consumption data |
| **Expected Outcome** | Data quality improvement and prevention of stockouts due to system errors |

**Examples of Erroneous Forecasts:**
- Predicting zero quantities for essential items
- Quantities 50% higher/lower than recent consumption without seasonal justification
- Recommendations based on outdated stock data

**Override Process:**

User directly edits forecast quantity to correct value.

**Mandatory Reasons:**
- Data entry error
- System forecasting error
- Changed consumption pattern

---

### UC-06: Nutrition Program Enrollment Surge

**Baseline Context:** WFP stakeholder feedback emphasized nutrition supply adequacy for vulnerable populations including refugees and climate-affected communities. Persistent stockouts require improvisation and risk program effectiveness.

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Trigger** | Nutrition Appointment Platform reports 500+ new beneficiaries enrolled |
| **System Recommendation** | Tier 3 district model adjusts demand forecast for nutrition commodities (RUTF, micronutrient supplements, ORS) based on enrollment data |
| **Decision Authority** | District Supply Officer in coordination with nutrition program officers |
| **Data Inputs** | Nutrition Appointment Platform enrollment data, nutrition commodity stock levels, facility capacity assessments, WFP LESS delivery schedules |
| **Expected Outcome** | Proactive stock allocation prevents shortages during program scaling. Supply adequacy indicators pushed back to Nutrition Appointment Platform |

**Override Process:**

District officer reviews allocation recommendations across facilities and can adjust based on:
- Geographic distribution of beneficiaries
- Facility storage capacity for nutrition commodities
- Existing stock levels
- Delivery logistics to refugee settlements or remote areas

**Mandatory Reasons:**
- Nutrition program expansion
- Refugee influx
- Seasonal malnutrition spike
- Redistribution for equitable access

## Integration, Monitoring & Learning

### Integration

These use cases are embedded within the offline app and district dashboard workflows, following the **Integration Maturity Model (Level 2: Opportunistic Sync)**.

### Monitoring

All overrides are logged with:
- User ID
- Timestamp
- Original value
- Final value
- Reason

**Logs serve two purposes:**

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Learning** | Identify systematic forecasting errors and improve Tier 1 rules and Tier 3 models |
| **Accountability** | Provide transparent audit trail for procurement decisions |

### No-Blame Principle

{% hint style="info" %}
**High override rates are a flag for system improvement, not user penalization.**

Override frequency above 50% for a specific commodity at a facility triggers investigation of forecasting assumptions, not disciplinary action.
{% endhint %}

## Value-for-Money (VfM) Assessment Framework

This framework evaluates ROI using the standard **4E model**, separating hard financial savings from operational efficiency gains.

### Key VfM Indicators

| Category | Indicators |
|----------|------------|
| **Economy (Spending Less)** | Reduction in expiries (UGX), Emergency logistics cost reduction, Deployment cost per facility |
| **Efficiency (Spending Well)** | Staff hours saved per ordering cycle, Sync reliability (target: >90%) |
| **Effectiveness (Spending Wisely)** | Stockout duration reduction (baseline: 120 days), Forecast accuracy improvement (MAPE) |
| **Equity (Spending Fairly)** | Variance reduction in stockout days between RRH and refugee-hosting facilities |

### Data Sources

| Type | Sources |
|------|---------|
| **Hard Costs** | NMS Invoices (expiry values), District Fuel Logs (transport costs), Project Financial Reports |
| **Soft Metrics** | System Activity Logs (sync rates, processing time), DHIS2 (stockout duration) |

### Sample VfM Calculation

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total Annual Cost | UGX 50 million (maintenance, server, support) |
| Drug Expiry Reduction | UGX 80 million saved |
| Logistics Savings | UGX 20 million (fuel/per diems) |
| **Total Hard Savings** | **UGX 100 million** |
| **Financial ROI** | **(100M - 50M) / 50M = 100%** |

### Governance

- **Quarterly Technical Reviews:** MAPE, sync rates reviewed to fix model drift
- **Annual Financial Review:** MoH and partners evaluate if system pays for itself in saved commodities
